## Goal: Using Python, perform an exploratory data analysis of the CCM Computing Courses Entry Surveys.  Provide insights that can help the Information Technologies department increase enrollment in computing classes.
#### I will be following the Exploratory Data Analysis process to provide these recommendations over the next month.  There are four parts of the project that will be due in separate assignments.
### Part 1.  Data Study Questions - Formulate the data study questions that I will answer in my analysis.  I will also be assigned a few questions to answer by my instructor. 
### Part 2.  Data Exploration and Cleaning - The datasets provided are messy.  I will explore the datasets, first in Excel. Then I will use Python to bring in my datasets into my coding environment, and explore the datasets further to identify what cleaning actions I will perform on the data.
### Part 3.  Data Analysis and Visualization - Using my cleaned dataset, I will then perform analysis to answer my data science questions. My answers will be displayed using plotting techniques.  I will house my project and associated files on my Project 1 repository on GitHub.
### Part 4.  Improve Plots - I will provide and receive feedback to/from my classmates via a Discussion Forum.
#### Attached are 2 zip files containing the survey results for the years 2020-2023 from two different populations of students: computing majors and non-computing majors.
